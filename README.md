The Code Corps API is an open source Rails::API backend that powers the Code Corps platform. It includes:

- developer and project matchmaking
- project management tooling
- a donations engine that distributes donations to projects

## Developer installation guide

### First steps

1. Install and configure PostgreSQL 9.3+.
  1. Run `postgres -V` to see if you already have it.
  2. Make sure that the server's messages language is English; this is [required](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3006c59bc7a50c925f6b744447f1d94533a64241/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb#L1140) by the ActiveRecord Postgres adapter.
2. Install Ruby 2.2.2 and Bundler.
3. Clone the project and bundle.

### Before you start Rails

1. `bundle install`
2. `bundle exec rake db:create db:migrate db:test:prepare db:seed`
3. `bundle exec rake db:seed_fu`
4. Try running the specs: `bundle exec rake spec`
5. Install and make sure redis is running
   * Follow the [official quickstart guide](http://redis.io/topics/quickstart)
   * It's best to install it as a service instead of running it manually
   * To make sure everything works and the service is running, execute `redis-cli ping` in the console. It should respond with `PONG`
6. Run the api with `bundle exec rails server`


### To make sure the API is running properly

Point your browser (or make a direct request) to http://api.lvh.me:3000/ping. There should be a `{"ping":"pong"}` response from it.


### Testing helpers

We've written some convenience helpers to help with API testing. The helpers are found in `spec/support/helpers` as:

- `ApiHelpers`
  - `authenticate` which is an authentication helper that uses OAuth2 to authenticate requests and return a token used to make future requests.
- `RequestHelpers`
  - `json` which returns the JSON of the last response as a Ruby object
  - `authenticated_get(path, args, token)` (and `_post`, `_put`, `_delete`) which takes the URL path, any arguments, and the token generated by the `authenticate` method above. You can grep for good examples of these in action.

These helpers are included in specs by default via the `rails_helper`. You can just call these methods directly.


### Working with Ember

The CodeCorps API is intended to work alongside a client written in Ember. For that purpose, the rails application exposes all of it's API endpoints behind an `api.` subdomain.

On the Ember client side of things, we use [`ember-cli-deploy`](https://github.com/ember-cli/ember-cli-deploy) with a `redis` plugin to deploy the client application to redis. Multiple revisions are maintained this way.

Any server request pointing to the main domain and not the `api.` subdomain is redirected to `ember_index_controller#index`. There, depending on the remainder of the request path and the current environment, a specific revision of the ember app is retrieved from redis and rendered. This can be
* the development revision, if the current environment is development
* a specific deployed revision in production if the request contains a revision parameter in SHORT_UUID format
* the latest deployed revision in production if the request does not contain a revision parameter
* A plain text string containing "INDEX NOT FOUND" if a revision was specified, but the key for the specified revision was not found by redis


## Built with

- [Rails::API](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) — Our backend API is a Rails::API app which uses JSON API to respond RESTfully to requests.
- [Ember.js](https://github.com/emberjs/ember.js) — Our frontend is an Ember.js app that communicates with the Rails API.
- [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) — Our primary data store uses Postgres.
